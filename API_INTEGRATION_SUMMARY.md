## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: Why are we using three different API services?
**A:** Each service provides specialized functionality:
- **Explorium:** Best-in-class B2B data enrichment
- **OpenAI:** State-of-the-art AI/ML capabilities
- **Supabase:** Managed database and authentication

The combination provides comprehensive functionality while maintaining flexibility.

### Q: How can we reduce costs?
**A:** Three main strategies:
1. **Caching** (40-60% reduction) - Cache frequently accessed data
2. **Batch Processing** (30% reduction) - Use bulk API calls when available
3. **Smart Model Selection** (95% reduction for simple tasks) - Use cheaper models

### Q: What happens if an API goes down?
**A:** Multi-layered resilience:
1. **Circuit Breaker:** Stops calling failed services
2. **Fallback Providers:** Alternative data sources
3. **Cached Data:** Serve from cache during outages
4. **Graceful Degradation:** Partial functionality maintained

### Q: Is the ROI realistic?
**A:** Yes, because:
- Conservative assumptions ($5 revenue per enrichment)
- Proven B2B lead conversion rates (2-5%)
- Low operational costs (<$0.53 per enrichment)
- High-value B2B transactions ($50-500 per conversion)

### Q: How long until we're profitable?
**A:** Very quickly:
- Break-even: Month 1 (after covering $12K initial investment)
- Positive cash flow: Immediately (after initial investment)
- Full payback: 0.8 months at moderate scale
